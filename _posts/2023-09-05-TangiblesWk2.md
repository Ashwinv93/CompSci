This week I had to set up my lab notebook including writing plans for every week. I also wanted to add some games to my blog, but the html code for some of the games, like game of life and Pac-Man, did not work as intended because of my theme. This caused my make command to stop working untill I deleted the files of the game. I then had to go to go into the html code and change the pixel dimentions so that it would fit. That allowed me to finaly include the games that I wanted to include. Another problem I found near the end of the week was that my commits stoped working to github.
