## What We Did

- The second week we got our flask server running, and we launched our aws server. We also atempted to create the pack opening fucntion. 
- I personaly was in charge of creating and finding insperation for the front end, and I also used an online api to create a simple search "Pokedex" that allows a user to search for any pokemon they want, and get information about it.
- Next week we want to be compleated with the pack opening and creating 
## Issues

-Not many issues this week, because it was mostly planing, but while working on the search api, I had troble getting the front end to look good, so I used chat gpt to help me get it looking better.
