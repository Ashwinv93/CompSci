# Individual Review
## First Few Weeks
The first few weeks of this trimester were spent working on a CPT warmup project that needed to involve binary an RGB. For this project I made a Ascii image generator. My team made other features that also had to do with RGB and binary, such as the image RGB adjustor, or the Text to color converter.

## College Board Reveiw (2020 MC)
After the project had been compleated, we were tasked to compleate the practice MC on college board, and right a review and do corrections for questions that were incorrect. I got a 55/67 on the test and Mr. Mort gave me a 1.85/2 on my review.

## Team Teaches
Throught all of this trimester, we have been having student lesson on college board topic that dont really have alot to do with code, but are still important. The team teaches are all in the hacks section of my timebox. After we had compleated all the team teaches and the homeworks, I created a table for all of my homework scores and my median score. This was presented to Mr. Mort in a quick individual reveiw. We also made our own team teach on Routing and Computing
