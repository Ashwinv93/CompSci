## Relfection on Glows:
I felt our demo was informative and interesting, since we would ask people how much they knew about computor science, before we conducted our demo. This made it so we always understood our audience, and catered to their level of understanding. Our team had alot of features, since we had 5 people in our team and we had a full login system, which included deleting and editing users. This could have made our demo very lengthy but I think we kept it a short aspossible, while still making a compleate presentation. Individualy I felt very comferable explaining my feature and the code in the frountend and backend.
