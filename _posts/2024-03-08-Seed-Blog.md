## What I did: 
Our CPT project was clash royale themed, and my individual feature was a chest opener, where a user could open chest, to get cards, that were added to their collection. I had to create a database in the backend which mapped a users id to the cards id, so that each user would have a personalized collection. Amoung this, I also helped create the Login/Signup pages, and personaly created the front page for our website, and a edit/delete feature for users. My and dante features use a database we created, containing all the cards and their data like, elixer cost, a picture, and their max level.
